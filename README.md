I Used Apache NetBeans IDE 21 for coding part which helped me to code easily. We just need to design and then the code gets automatically put in the file, we just need to add the coding part in the functionalities to invoke that functions.
So Jframe has helped us which makes the work simpler.
We also installed some files like "mysql-connector-8.3" and "rs2xml" to add into the JAR folder to get rid of some issues.
For the creation of database i downloaded MySql and then added it to the environment variables thereby activating it and creating the database with "Student_Information" table and "Result" table.
